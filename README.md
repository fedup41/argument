# argument
This is a full featured command line argument processor for Java. 
Essentially, it allows your program to get run-time direction from
the user as they execute it on the command line. 

Example: yourProgram --tail

This assumes that you have written a program called "yourProgram" and 
that it will need to do something special if the users also enters the 
--tail argument. "argument" is a library that makes handling this type 
of command line interaction very easy to implement.
